# Multi-Purpose-Field-Surveillance-Robot
This project describes about the design, construction and fabrication of multi-purpose field surveillance robot that can be used for land mine detection, toxic gas sensing and temperature and humidity sensor monitoring in war fields without putting serious manual risks. The land mine detector can detect covered metals, ultrasonic sensor, gas sensor can detect toxic gas attacks and the robot can be controlled wirelessly in Android phone and we watch live stream wirelessly with ESP32 Camera Board. PIR sensor detection the motion and if sensor detects any motion then ESP32 Camera capture image and sent through telegram application. For robot tracing we included GPS module it will give geo location of the robot via android app. The robot uses ESP32 microcontroller to gather sensor information and WiFi to interface the controller and the robot. Based on the input information from Android application, the robot can make moved and climbed on any terrains. The distinguishing feature of our project from traditional ones is that the integrated design of Android phone operation and multiple IoT cloud servers. All robotic sensor information is delivered to cloud servers and viewed through Webpage and Android application like Telegram app and MIT App. This way the robot can be used both at Military war fields and monitored at Military headquarters simultaneously. This is a novel attempt to integrate field robots and IoT technologies at an expandable mode of design. Inatially we are adding a sensors data to the google firebase cloud and we monitor using the android application. Additional enhancement of the design made it an outstanding choice for deployment and use in dangerous zones infested with land mines and other hazardous metallic items.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
The system we have proposed consist number of features like soldier identification, for monitoring various parameters in the environment, remote monitoring and controlling mechanism etc. The system consists of Micro-controller, Ultrasonic sensor, PIR sensor, Metal detector, Gas sensor, Temperature sensor, DC motor for assembly and Wi-Fi module for wireless communication between Microcontroller system and Android phone having Android web server which we have designed as per our application. This robot will continuously check for bomb detection with the help of Metal detector and send information to the Android application using Wi-Fi connectivity. The robot will move by analysing the obstacles in the path. PIR sensor to detects the motion and it sent an image to a telegram mobile application and we can watch a live stream. The hazardous gases are detected like LPG with the help of Gas sensor interfaced in the system for safety purpose. We are able to control the movement of robot remotely using Android application.
